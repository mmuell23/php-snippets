Be sure to have PHP and Composer installed:
http://getcomposer.org/

Let's go:

a. Install and run Selenium Server:
http://phpunit.de/manual/3.7/en/selenium.html

b. Run composer install

c. Run ./vendor/bin/phpunit to start Selenium Tests

To record tets:

Install Add-Ons in Firefox:
Selenium IDE: http://docs.seleniumhq.org/download/
Selenium PHP Formatters: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-php-formatters/ 

Now you're able to record tests and store those directly as PHPUnit-Tests. Be sure to change the classname of each stored tests.
